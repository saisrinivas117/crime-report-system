[RFC6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) Cookies and CookieJar for Node.js

[![npm package](https://nodei.co/npm/tough-cookie.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/tough-cookie/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/salesforce/tough-cookie.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/salesforce/tough-cookie)

# Synopsis

``` javascript
var tough = require('tough-cookie');
var Cookie = tough.Cookie;
var cookie = Cookie.parse(header);
cookie.value = 'somethingdifferent';
header = cookie.toString();

var cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar();
cookiejar.setCookie(cookie, 'http://currentdomain.example.com/path', cb);
// ...
cookiejar.getCookies('http://example.com/otherpath',function(err,cookies) {
  res.headers['cookie'] = cookies.join('; ');
});
```

# Installation

It's _so_ easy!

`npm install tough-cookie`

Why the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.

## Version Support

Support for versions of node.js will follow that of the [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) module.

# API

## tough

Functions on the module you get from `require('tough-cookie')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don't need to be "bound".

**Note**: prior to 1.0.x, several of these functions took a `strict` parameter. This has since been removed from the API as it was no longer necessary.

### `parseDate(string)`

Parse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.

### `formatDate(date)`

Format a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).

### `canonicalDomain(str)`

Transforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).

### `domainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])`

Answers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".

The `canonicalize` parameter will run the other two parameters through `canonicalDomain` or not.

### `defaultPath(path)`

Given a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie.  This is basically the "directory" of a "file" in the path, but is specified by Section 5.1.4 of the RFC.

The `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (i.e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.).  This is the `.pathname` property of node's `uri.parse()` output.

### `pathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)`

Answers "does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?" as per RFC6265 Section 5.1.4.  Returns a boolean.

This is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.

### `parse(cookieString[, options])`

alias for `Cookie.parse(cookieString[, options])`

### `fromJSON(string)`

alias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`

### `getPublicSuffix(hostname)`

Returns the public suffix of this hostname.  The public suffix is the shortest domain-name upon which a cookie can be set.  Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.

For example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.

For further information, see http://publicsuffix.org/.  This module derives its list from that site. This call is currently a wrapper around [`psl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/psl)'s [get() method](https://www.npmjs.com/package/psl#pslgetdomain).

### `cookieCompare(a,b)`

For use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2). The sort algorithm is, in order of precedence:

* Longest `.path`
* oldest `.creation` (which has a 1ms precision, same as `Date`)
* lowest `.creationIndex` (to get beyond the 1ms precision)

``` javascript
var cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];
cookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);
```

**Note**: Since JavaScript's `Date` is limited to a 1ms precision, cookies within the same milisecond are entirely possible. This is especially true when using the `now` option to `.setCookie()`. The `.creationIndex` property is a per-process global
